# Video Conversion with Inpainting - Code Documentation

This documentation provides a detailed explanation of the Python code for video conversion with inpainting. The code utilizes the OpenCV library to convert Standard Definition (SD) resolution videos to High Definition (HD) resolution, filling in the left side of each frame using inpainting.

## 1. Introduction

The provided Python script (`main.py`) aims to convert videos from SD resolution (640 x 480 pixels) to HD resolution (1280 x 720 pixels) using an inpainting technique. Inpainting fills in the blank areas on the left side of each video frame with relevant pixels or image parts.

## 2. Dependencies

The code relies on the following Python libraries:

- **OpenCV (`cv2`):** A computer vision library for image and video processing.
- **NumPy:** A library for numerical operations in Python.

Ensure these libraries are installed before running the code.

## 3. Function: `convert_video`

### Steps:

1. **Open Video File:** The function opens the input video file using OpenCV's `cv2.VideoCapture` class.

2. **Get Video Properties:** Retrieves the width and height of the video frames using `cap.get(3)` and `cap.get(4)`.

3. **Define Target HD Resolution:** Sets the target HD resolution to 1280 x 720 pixels.

4. **Create VideoWriter Object:** Initializes a `cv2.VideoWriter` object to save the output video. It uses the `'mp4v'` codec, 20 frames per second, and the target HD resolution.

5. **Loop Through Frames:** Iterates through each frame of the input video using a `while` loop.

6. **Resize Frame:** Resizes each frame to the target HD resolution using `cv2.resize`.

7. **Inpainting:** Calls the `inpaint` function to fill in the left side of the frame.

8. **Write to Output Video:** Writes the inpainted frame to the output video using the `out.write` method.

9. **Release Resources:** Closes the input and output video files using `cap.release()` and `out.release()`.

10. **Close Windows (if applicable):** Closes OpenCV windows if the GUI is available.

## 4. Function: `inpaint`

### Steps:

1. **Create Grayscale Mask:** Generates a grayscale mask using NumPy. The mask is a 2D array with the same dimensions as the input frame, where the left 50 pixels are set to 255.

2. **Inpainting Process:** Applies the inpainting process using OpenCV's `cv2.inpaint` method. The method takes the input frame, mask, inpainting radius, and flags as parameters.

3. **Return Inpainted Frame:** Returns the inpainted frame as the output.

## 5. Example Usage

An example usage is provided at the end of the script, demonstrating how to convert a video from an input path to an output path.

## 6. Conclusion

This code serves as a simple prototype for video conversion with inpainting, filling in blank areas on the left side of each frame.
